Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. 
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
